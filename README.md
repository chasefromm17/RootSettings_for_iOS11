# RootSettings_for_iOS11

ABOUT THE PART OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BENNG ADDED TO ASYNC_WAKE EXPLOIT FROM BENJIBOBS (ASYNC_WAKE EXPLOIT BY IAN BEER ORIGIALLY/CREDS TO HIM)

I've modified the Reachability and folders parts of this RootSettings.plist/RootSettings.previous.plist only IIRC, and so, I'm waiting for this to be added to async_wake exploit for iOS 11.1.2 since I'm shit at adding this manually :/ Remember when benjibobs added the ability for screen res change? Same here, just with internal settings obviously :P
