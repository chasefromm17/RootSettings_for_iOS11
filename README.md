# RootSettings_for_iOS11

<b>UPDATE AS OF 5/17/18: THIS IS DEEMED OUTDATED, AND WON'T BE USEFUL FOR THE ELECTRA JAILBREAK FOR IOS 11.0-11.1.2. PLEASE WAIT UNTIL IOS 11.2/11.3.X CAN BE JAILBROKEN TO USE THIS</b>

ABOUT THE PART OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BEING ADDED TO ASYNC_WAKE EXPLOIT FROM BENJIBOBS (ASYNC_WAKE EXPLOIT BY IAN BEER ORIGIALLY/CREDS TO HIM)

I've modified the Reachability and folders parts of this RootSettings.plist/RootSettings.previous.plist only IIRC, and so, I'm waiting for this to be added to async_wake exploit for iOS 11.1.2 since I'm shit at adding this manually :/ Remember when benjibobs added the ability for screen res change? Same here, just with internal settings obviously :P
